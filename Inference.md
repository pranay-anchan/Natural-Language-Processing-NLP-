# Inference/ Conclusion

Automatic text summarization started gaining ground in the late 1990â€™s (Mani, 1999).  The technique is still being studied but is much further advanced than new techniques such as extractive and abstractive text summarization.  Thus, Automatic text summarization is more developed and allows for summaries with more coherence, cohesion, and understanding.  There are also more ready to work automatic and extractive text summarization tools available.  The initial hypothesis followed the best summarization technique is an automatic or extractive technique and this can be seen in the table above with the tool examples.  Given the best results are longer, the following list can enable the abstract techniques to perform better. 
1. Train, validate, and test models with genre specific text:  Some of the best abstractive techniques are built around specific genre text.  Thus, when analyzing movie review or shopping reviews, a text like the Amazon reviews will support model and word development best. But when analyzing legal documents or more technical papers, a new corpus or dataset designed from legal texts will suit the model more efficiently (Kanapala et al., 2019) . 

2. Train the models on longer documents: The are two newer studies aiming to use long documents for training (Cohen, 2018; Xaio, 2019) .
The same dataset for training required modification for our implementation and thus was not used. 

3. Implement Rouge scoring on the output summarizations to identify a baseline against human interpretation.   
Overall, this study shows abstractive summarization techniques still require more study to effectively summarize long documents. 
The approach of passing a summarized model into the abstractive model still proved difficult for the generating summary models.  Thus, extractive and automatic summarization models work best for identifying the most coherent and cohesive summaries.  As more studies are performed and tools designed, it is likely within a few years that abstractive techniques will equal or surpass extractive summarization techniques.
